# Semantic Segmentation Deep Learning

##Utilize the Camvid dataset - a small dataset of 701 images for self-driving perception.

##Implement PSPNet by using ResNet backbone, but uses dilation to increase the receptive field, and aggregates context over different portions of the image with a "Pyramid Pooling Module"(PPM)

##Transfer Learning: Utilize the PSPNet trained on Camvid dataset as our pre-trained model and train it on KITTI road segmentation dataset.

## See the doc for more details
